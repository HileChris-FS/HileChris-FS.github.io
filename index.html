<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hi!  I'm Chere, and I've been designing since 2007.  I love deep, rich colors the most (hello, teal!) but I love to switch up sometimes to keep myself on my toes.  I like to draw my own artwork for things, which makes my designs a little quirky and fresh.  I'm married to Chris, and we have two almost grown daughters, Makenna and Melanie, two cats, and Elvis the hamster.  We live in Central Ohio and love to be close to our family here.  I also love to read, crochet, and make art on my iPad, and I'm slightly addicted to cooking shows.</p>
